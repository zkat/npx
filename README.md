# npx(1) -- execute npm package binaries

## SYNOPSIS

`npx [--package|-p <package>] [--cache <path>] [--save-dev|-D] [--save-prod|-P] [--save-optional|-O] [--save-bundle|-B] [--save-exact|-E] [--global|-g] [--prefix|-C] [--userconfig <path>] [-c <string>] [--ignore-existing] [--version|-v] [--] <command>[@version] [command-arg]...`

## INSTALL

`npm install -g npx`

## DESCRIPTION

Executes `<command>` either from a local `node_modules/.bin`, or from a central cache, installing any packages needed in order for `<command>` to run.

By default, `npx` will check whether `<command>` exists in `$PATH`, or in the local project binaries, and execute that. If `<command>` is not found, it will be installed prior to execution.

An optional `@version` may be appended to specify the package version required, which defaults to `latest` only if `<command>` is not in the path. If the command is already present and no explicit version specifier was requested, the existing command will be used.

If a version specifier is included, or if `--package` is used, npx will ignore the version of the package in the current path, if it exists. This can also be forced with the `--ignore-existing` flag.

* `-p, --package <package>` - define the package to be installed. This defaults to the value of `<command>`. This is only needed for packages with multiple binaries if you want to call one of the other executables, or where the binary name does not match the package name. If this option is provided `<command>` will be executed as-is, without interpreting `@version` if it's there.

* `--cache <path>` - set the location of the npm cache. Defaults to npm's own cache settings.

* `-g, --global` - install the package globally before execution.

* `-D, --save-dev, -P, --save-prod, -O, --save-optional, -B, --save-bundle, -E, --save-exact` - install the package in the current npm project and save it to `package.json` following the same option conventions for this as `npm install` would.

* `-C, --prefix` - The location to install global items. If used without `-g`, will force any installs to run in the specified folder. Defaults to whatever npm's default is.

* `--userconfig` - path to the user configuration file to pass to npm. Defaults to whatever npm's current default is.

* `-c <string>` - Execute `<string>` with delayed environment variable evaluation.

* `--shell-auto-fallback [shell]` - Generates shell code to override your shell's "command not found" handler with one that calls `npx`. Tries to figure out your shell, or you can pass its name (either `bash`, `fish`, or `zsh`) as an option. See below for how to install.

* `--ignore-existing` - If this flag is set, npx will not look in `$PATH`, or in the current package's `node_modules/.bin` for an existing version before deciding whether to install. Binaries in those paths will still be available for execution, but will be shadowed by any packages requested by this install.

* `-v, --version` - Show the current npx version.

## EXAMPLES

### Running a project-local bin

```
$ npm i -D webpack
$ npx webpack -- ...
```

### One-off invocation without local installation

```
$ npm rm webpack
$ npx webpack -- ...
$ cat package.json
...webpack not in "devDependencies"...
```

### Execute binary and add it to package.json as a devDependency

```
$ npx -D webpack -- ...
$ cat package.json
...webpack added to "devDependencies"
```

## SHELL AUTO FALLBACK

To install permanently, add the relevant line to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.config/fish/config.fish`, or as needed. To install just for the shell session, simply run the line.

Be warned that this _will_ send (almost) all your missed commands over the internet, then fetch and execute code automatically.

### For Bash:

```
$ source <(npx --shell-auto-fallback bash)
```

### For Fish:

```
$ source (npx --shell-auto-fallback fish | psub)
```

### For Zsh:

```
$ source <(npx --shell-auto-fallback zsh)
```

Huge thanks to [Kwyn Meagher](https://blog.kwyn.io) for generously donating the package name in the main npm registry. Previously `npx` was used for a Tessel board Neopixels library, which can now be found under [`npx-tessel`](https://npm.im/npx-tessel).
